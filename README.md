This repository contains MATLAB implementations of the 3D-GESPAR algorithm in the `3DGSPR` directory.
A lightweight Python port is available in the `py3dgespar` package. You can run a small
demonstration using:

```bash
python -m py3dgespar
```

The Python code provides basic functions for experimenting with the 3D-GESPAR approach.
